# sof-installer
A single script to install smart-on-fhir.

# Motivation
I decided to setup a stand alone smart-on-fhir instance due to my interest in developing interoperable medical apps. I went over to the smart-on-fhir github page and read and went through the steps outlined under their install section. However, I ran into various troubles in doing so. Thus, I've decided to write this script. All the problems I ran into is outlined and discussed below.
